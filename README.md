This analysis does not add value directly to this specific project, bBut it does show its potential: <br>
NHS can utilise tweets:<br>
-	Great way to increase the visibility of customers’ tweets / trending topics.<br>
-	It is a great way to find out the reactions of people to an event as it happens, whether it’s entertainment or breaking news, or COVID. <br>
-	Creating polls, and maybe even paying for advertising to increase the reach of NHS.<br>
